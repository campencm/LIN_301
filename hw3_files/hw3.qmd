"The easiest part of this assignment was making the hw3_file"

"The hardest part of this assignment was figuring out how to make your code work to assign the text variable to the shakespere.txt"

"To help them find the words they would like to analyze because could you imagine having to read all of shakepeare's works just to find how many times someone says a specific word"

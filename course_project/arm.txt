Now it all started two Thanksgivin’s ago

It was on two years ago on Thanksgivin’ 

When my friend ‘nd I went up to visit Alice at the
restaurant

But Alice doesn't live in the restaurant

She lives in the church nearby the restaurant in the bell tower with her husband Ray, ‘n’ Facha the dog

‘n’ livin' in the bell tower like that, they got a lot of room downstairs where the pews used to be 

‘n’ havin' all that room, seein' as how they took out all the pews, they decided that they didn't have to take out their garbage for a long time

We got up there, we found all the garbage in there 

and we decided it'd be a friendly gesture for us to take the garbage down to the city dump

So we took the half a ton of garbage, put it in the back of a red VW Microbus

Took shovels, and rakes, and implements of destruction ‘n’ headed on toward the city dump

Well, we got there ‘n’ there’s a big sign an’ a chain across the dump sayin’, "Closed on Thanksgivin’" 

‘n’ we had never heard of a dump closed on Thanksgivin’ before

‘n’ with tears in our eyes, we drove off into the sunset lookin’ for another place to put the garbage

We didn't find one

‘Til we came to a side-road ‘n’ off the side of the side-road was another fifteen-foot cliff 

‘n’ a at the bottom of the cliff was another pile of garbage

‘n’ we decided that one big pile was better than two little piles

An’, rather than bring that one up we decided to throw ours down

That's what we did ‘n’ Drove back to the church

Had a Thanksgivin’ dinner that couldn't be beat

Went to sleep ‘n’ didn't get up until the next mornin’

When we got a phone call from Officer Obie

He said, "Kid, we found your name on a envelope at the bottom of of a half a ton of garbage ‘n’ Just wanted to know if you had any information about it" 

an’ I said, "Yes sir, Officer Obie I cannot tell a lie I put that envelope under that garbage"

After speakin’ to Obie for about forty-five minutes on the telephone

We finally arrived at the truth of the matter an’ said that we had to go down, ‘n’ pick up the garbage

‘N’ also had to go down, ‘n’ speak to him at the police officer station

So we got in the red VW Microbus with the shovels, and rakes, and implements of destruction ‘n’ headed on toward the police officer station

Now, friends, there was only one o’ two things that Obie could’a done at the police station

‘an the first was that he could’a give us a medal for bein’ so brave, ‘n’ honest on the telephone

Which wasn't very likely, and we didn't expect it

‘an’ the other thing was that he could’a bawled us out an’ told us never to be seen drivin’ garbage aroun’ the vicinity again

Which is what we expected 

But when we got to the police officer station there was a third possibility that we hadn't even counted upon

And we was both immediately arrested ‘n’ handcuffed 

‘n’ I said, "Obie, I don't think I can pick up the garbage with these handcuffs on" 

He said, "Shut up kid, get in the back of the patrol car"

‘n’ that's what we did ‘n’ Sat in the back of the patrol car ‘n’ drove to the, quote, scene of the crime, unquote

I wanna to tell you ‘bout the town of Stockbridge, Massachusetts, where this is happenin’ here

They got three stop signs, two police officers ‘n’ one police car

But when we got to the scene of the crime 

There was five police officers, ‘n’ three police cars

Bein’ the biggest crime of the last fifty years ‘n’ everybody wanted to get in the newspaper story about it

And they was usin’ up all kinds of cop equipment that they had hangin’ around the police officer station

They was takin’ plaster tire-track footprints, dog smellin’ prints

‘n’ they took twenty-seven eight-by-ten colored glossy photographs

With circles and arrows An’ a paragraph on the back of each one

Explainin’ what each one was to be used as evidence against us

Took pictures of the approach, the getaway

The northwest corner, ’n’ southwest corner

An’ that's not to mention the aerial photography

After the ordeal, we went back to the jail

Obie said he was gonna put us in a cell

Said, "Kid, I'm gonna put you in a cell I want your wallet an’ your belt" 

‘n’ I said, "Obie, I can understand you wantin’ my wallet so I don't have any money to spend in the cell, but what do you want my belt for?" 

‘n’ he said, "Kid, we don't want any hangin’s" 

I said, "Obie, did you think I was gonna hang myself for litterin’?"

Obie said he was makin’ sure an’, friends, Obie was

‘Cause he took out the toilet seat so I couldn't hit myself over the head ‘n’ drown

An’ he took out the toilet paper so I couldn't bend the bars, roll out roll the toilet paper out the window slide down the roll ‘n’ have an escape

Obie was making sure

An’ it was about four, or five hours later that Alice

Remember Alice? 

It’s a song about Alice

Alice came by an’, with a few nasty words to Obie on the side, bailed us out of jail

An’ we went back to the church

Had another Thanksgivin’ dinner that couldn't be beat

‘n’ didn't get up until the next mornin’ when we all had to go to court

We walked in, sat down

Obie came in 

With the twenty-seven eight by ten colored glossy pictures 

With the circles ‘n’ arrows an’ a paragraph on the back of each one

‘n’ sat down

Man came in, said, "All rise" 

We all stood up ‘n’ Obie stood up 

With the twenty-seven eight by ten colored glossy pictures

‘n’ the judge walked in Sat down with a seeing eye dog 

‘n’ he sat down

We sat down

Obie looked at the seeing eye dog

An’ then at the twenty-seven eight by ten colored glossy pictures 

With circles an’ arrows an’ a paragraph on the back of each one

an’ looked at the seeing eye dog

an’ then at twenty-seven eight by ten colored glossy pictures 

With circles the ‘n’ arrows an’ a paragraph on the back of each one 

An’ began to cry cause Obie came to the realization that it was a typical case of American blind justice

An’ there wasn't nothin’ he could do about it an’ the judge wasn't gonna look

At the twenty-seven eight by ten colored glossy pictures 

With the circles ‘n’ arrows an’ a paragraph on the back of each one

explainin’ what each one was to be used as evidence against us

An’ we was fined fifty dollars ‘n’ had to pick up the garbage in the snow
